## 🧠 Overview

SV-Core is a minimal, modular teleological architecture designed to add goal-oriented cognitive structure to Large Language Models (LLMs) without modifying model weights.

This prototype provides:

- goal-conditioned memory (μ-TEL)  
- structural semantic transformation (Λ)  
- orientation shaping (Ω*)  
- internal stabilization (⦿, CΩ)  
- phase-transition dynamics (PTOr)

SV-Core is a **fully executable subset** of a larger cognitive framework (the Living System, SV), published as a standalone research prototype.

## 🧪 Features

- Clean, ~200-line PyTorch implementation  
- No retraining or fine-tuning required  
- Integrates with any transformer hidden states (LLaMA, Mistral, Phi, Qwen…)  
- Reproducible, interpretable, modular  
- Backed by a peer-review-ready scientific paper
