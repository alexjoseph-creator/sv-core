# SV-Core  
### A Teleological Cognitive Architecture for Agentic Large Language Models  
Author: **Alexandre Vinas (2025)**  

---

## 📌 Overview  
SV-Core is a minimal **teleological cognitive architecture** designed to provide  
Large Language Models with:

- structured internal dynamics  
- goal-oriented memory (μ-TEL)  
- stable internal states (⦿, CΩ)  
- qualitative transitions (PTOr)  
- a full cognitive pipeline  

This implementation is **executable**, **reproducible**, and written in PyTorch.
