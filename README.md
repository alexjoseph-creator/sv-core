## 🧠 Overview

SV-Core is a minimal, modular teleological architecture designed to add goal-oriented cognitive structure to Large Language Models (LLMs) without modifying model weights.

This prototype provides:

- goal-conditioned memory (**μ-TEL**)  
- structural semantic transformation (**Λ**)  
- orientation shaping (**Ω\*** )  
- internal stabilization (**⦿**, **CΩ**)  
- phase-transition dynamics (**PTOr**)  

SV-Core is a fully executable subset of a broader cognitive framework (the Living System, SV), published as a standalone research prototype.

## 🧪 Features

- Clean, ~200-line PyTorch implementation  
- No retraining or fine-tuning required  
- Integrates with any transformer hidden states (LLaMA, Mistral, Phi-3, Qwen…)  
- Reproducible, interpretable, modular  
- Backed by a peer-review-ready scientific paper

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexjoseph-creator/sv-core
cd sv-core
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Quick Example

```python
import torch
from sv_core import SVCore

model = SVCore(dim=512)

x = torch.randn(1, 512)
goal = torch.randn(1, 512)

output = model(x, goal)
print(output)
```
